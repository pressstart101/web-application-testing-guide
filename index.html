					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Configure Burp to passively spider the site.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Browse the entire application in the normal way, visiting every link and URL, submitting every form, and proceeding through all multistep functions to completion. Try browsing with JavaScript enabled and disabled, and with cookies enabled and disabled. Many applications can handle various browser configurations, and you may reach different content and code paths within the application.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If the application uses authentication, and you have or can create a login account, use this to access the protected functionality.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">As you browse, monitor the requests and responses passing through your intercepting proxy to gain an understanding of the kinds of data being submitted and the ways in which the client is used to control the behavior of the server-side application.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Review the site map generated by the passive spidering, and identify any content or functionality that you have not walked through using your browser. From the spider results, establish where each item was discovered (for example, in Burp Spider, check the Linked From details). Access each item using your browser so that the spider parses the response from the server to identify any further content. Continue this step recursively until no further content or functionality is identified.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">When you have finished manually browsing and passively spidering, you can use your spider to actively crawl the application, using the set of discovered URLs as seeds. This may sometimes uncover additional content that you overlooked when working manually. Before doing an automated crawl, first identify any URLs that are dangerous or likely to break the application session, and then configure the spider to exclude these from its scope.</a></li>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Use search engines and archives (such as the Wayback Machine) to identify what content they have indexed and stored for your target application.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Use advanced search options to improve the effectiveness of your research. For example, on Google you can use <span style="color:#ff5050">site:</span> to retrieve all the content for your target site and <span style="color:#ff5050">link:</span> to retrieve other sites that link to it. If your search identifies content that is no longer present in the live application, you may still be able to view this from the search engine’s cache. This old content may contain links to additional resources that have not yet been removed.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Perform searches on any names and e-mail addresses you have discovered in the application’s content, such as contact information. Include items not rendered on-screen, such as HTML comments. In addition to web searches, perform news and group searches. Look for any technical details posted to Internet forums regarding the target application and its supporting infrastructure.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Review any published WSDL files to generate a list of function names and parameter values potentially employed by the application.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Use Discover script: <span style="color:#ff5050">https://github.com/leebaird/discover</span> to automate some of these tasks.</a></li>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Confirm how the application handles requests for nonexistent items. Make some manual requests for known valid and invalid resources, and compare the server’s responses to establish an easy way to identify when an item does not exist.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Obtain listings of common file and directory names and common file extensions. Add to these lists all the items actually observed within the applications, and also items inferred from these. Try to understand the naming conventions used by application developers. For example, if there are pages called AddDocument.jsp and ViewDocument.jsp, there may also be pages called EditDocument.jsp and RemoveDocument.jsp.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Review all client-side code to identify any clues about hidden server-side content, including HTML comments and disabled form elements.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Using the automation techniques(i.e dirb web content scanner) make large numbers of requests based on your directory, filename, and file extension lists. Monitor the server’s responses to confirm which items are present and accessible.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Perform these content-discovery exercises recursively, using new enumerated content and patterns as the basis for further user-directed spidering and further automated discovery.</a></li>

For example, you can use the <span style="color:#ff5050">–root</span> option to specify a directory to check for default content, or <span style="color:#ff5050">-404</span> to specify a string that identifies a custom File Not Found page.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Verify any potentially interesting findings manually to eliminate any false positives within the results.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Request the server’s root directory, specifying the IP address in the Host header, and determine if the application responds with any different content. If so, run a Nikto scan against the IP address as well as the server name.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Make a request to the server’s root directory, specifying a range of <span style="color:#ff5050">User-Agent headers</span>, as shown at <span style="color:#ff5050">www.useragentstring.com/pages/ useragentstring.php</span>.</a></li>

						<li><a href="#0">If the application uses a parameter containing a function name, first determine its behavior when an invalid function is specified, and try to establish an easy way to identify when a valid function has been requested. Compile a list of common function names or cycle through the syntactic range of identifiers observed to be in use. Automate the exercise with scripts.</a></li>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Choose one or more application pages or functions where hidden debug parameters (such as debug=true) may be implemented. These are most likely to appear in key functionality such as login, search, and file upload or download.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Use listings of common debug parameter names (such as<span style="color:#ff5050">debug, test, hide</span>, and <span style="color:#ff5050">source</span>) and common values (such as <span style="color:#ff5050">true, yes, on</span>, and <span style="color:#ff5050">1</span>). Iterate through all permutations of these, submitting each name/value pair to each targeted function. For <span style="color:#ff5050">POST</span> requests, supply the parameter in both the URL query string and the request body. For example, you can use the cluster bomb attack type in Burp Intruder to combine all permutations of two payload lists.</a></li>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Identify any cases where client-side controls such as length limits and JavaScript checks are used to validate user input before it is submitted to the server. These controls can be bypassed easily, because you can send arbitrary requests to the server. For example: <span style="color:#ff5050"><xmp><form action=”order.asp” onsubmit=”return Validate(this)”><input maxlength=”3” name=”quantity”></xmp></span></a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Test each affected input field in turn by submitting input that would ordinarily be blocked by the client-side controls to verify whether these are replicated on the server.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">The ability to bypass client-side validation does not necessarily represent any vulnerability. Nevertheless, you should review closely what validation is being performed. Confirm whether the application is relying on the client-side controls to protect itself from malformed input. Also confirm whether any exploitable conditions exist that can be triggered by such input.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Review each HTML form to identify any disabled elements, such as grayed-out submit buttons. For example: <span style="color:#ff5050"><xmp><input disabled=”true” name=”product”></xmp></span> If you find any, submit these to the server, along with the form’s other parameters. See whether the parameter has any effect on the server’s processing that you can leverage in an attack. Alternatively, use an automated proxy rule to automatically enable disabled fields, such as Burp Proxy’s “HTML Modification” rules. </a></li>

For example:  <span style="color:#ff5050"><xmp><applet code=”input.class” id=”TheApplet” codebase=”/scripts/”></applet></xmp></span></a></li>
								<li><a href="#0">Review all calls made to the applet’s methods from within the invoking HTML, and determine whether data returned from the applet is being submitted to the server. If this data is opaque (that is, obfuscated or encrypted), to modify it you will probably need to decompile the applet to obtain its source code.</a></li>
								<li><a href="#0">Download the applet bytecode by entering the URL into your browser, and save the file locally. The name of the bytecode file is specified in the code attribute of the applet tag. The file will be located in the directory specified in the codebase attribute if this is present. Otherwise, it will be located in the same directory as the page in which the applet tag appears.</a></li>
								<li><a href="#0">Use a suitable tool to decompile the bytecode into source code. For example: <span style="color:#ff5050"><xmp>C:\>jad.exe input.class Parsing input.class... Generating input.jad</xmp></span> Here are some suitable tools for decompiling different browser extension components: <span style="color:#ff5050"><xmp>Java — Jad</xmp></span>  <span style="color:#ff5050"><xmp>Flash — SWFScan, Flasm/Flare</xmp></span>  <span style="color:#ff5050"><xmp>Silverlight — .NET Reflector</xmp></span> If the applet is packaged into a JAR, XAP, or SWF file, you can unpack it using a standard archive reader such as WinRar or WinZip. </a></li>
								<li><a href="#0">Review the relevant source code (starting with the implementation of the method that returns the opaque data) to understand what processing is being performed.</a></li>
								<li><a href="#0">Determine whether the applet contains any public methods that can be used to perform the relevant obfuscation on arbitrary input.</a></li>
								<li><a href="#0">If it doesn’t, modify the applet’s source to neutralize any validation it performs or to allow you to obfuscate arbitrary input. You can then recompile the source into its original file format using the compilation tools provided by the vendor.</a></li>

For example: <span style="color:#ff5050"><xmp><OBJECT> </xmp></span>   <span style="color:#ff5050"><xmp>classid=”CLSID:4F878398-E58A-11D3-BEE9-00C04FA0D6BA” </xmp></span><span style="color:#ff5050"><xmp>codebase=”https://wahh app.com/scripts/input.cab” </xmp></span> <span style="color:#ff5050"><xmp>id=”TheAxControl”></xmp></span><span style="color:#ff5050"><xmp></OBJECT></xmp></span> </a></li>
								<li><a href="#0">It is usually possible to subvert any input validation performed within an ActiveX control by attaching a debugger to the process and directly modifying data being processed or altering the program’s execution path.</a></li>
								<li><a href="#0">It is often possible to guess the purpose of different methods that an ActiveX control exports based on their names and the parameters passed to them. Use the <span style="color:#ff5050">COMRaider tool</span> to enumerate the methods exported by the control. Test whether any of these can be manipulated to affect the control’s behavior and defeat any validation tests it implements.</a></li>
								<li><a href="#0">If the control’s purpose is to gather or verify certain information about the client computer, use the Filemon and Regmon tools to monitor the information the control gathers. It is often possible to create suitable items within the system registry and filesystem to fix the inputs used by the control and therefore affect its behavior.</a></li>
								<li><a href="#0">Test any ActiveX controls for vulnerabilities that could be exploited to attack other users of the application. You can modify the HTML used to invoke a control to pass arbitrary data to its methods and monitor the results. Look for methods with dangerous-sounding names, such as LaunchExe. You can also use COMRaider to perform some basic fuzz testing of ActiveX controls to identify flaws such as buffer overflows.</a></li>

						<li><a href="#0">If the application uses session tokens, confirm precisely which pieces of data are actually used to reidentify users. Items that may be used to transmit tokens include HTTP cookies, query string parameters, and hidden form fields. Several different pieces of data may be used collectively to reidentify the user, and different items may be used by different back-end components. Often, items that look like session tokens may not actually be employed as such by the application, such as the default cookie generated by the web server.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">To verify which items are actually being employed as session tokens, find a page or function that is certainly session-dependent (such as a user-specific My Details page).

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Based on the core functionality implemented within the application, understand the broad requirements for access control in terms of vertical segregation (different levels of users have access to different types of functionality) and horizontal segregation (users at the same privilege level have access to different subsets of data). Often, both types of segregation are present. For example, ordinary users may be able to access their own data, while administrators can access everyone’s data.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Review your application mapping results to identify the areas of functionality and types of data resources that represent the most fruitful targets for privilege escalation attacks.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">To perform the most effective testing for access control vulnerabilities, you should ideally obtain a number of different accounts with different vertical and horizontal privileges. If self-registration is possible, you can probably obtain the latter directly from the application. To obtain the former, you will probably need the cooperation of the application owner (or need to exploit some vulnerability to gain access to a high-privileged account). The availability of different kinds of accounts will affect the types of testing you can perform, as described next.</a></li>

					<label for="sub-group-39">6.2 Test with Multiple Accounts</label>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">If the application enforces vertical privilege segregation, first use a powerful account to locate all the functionality it can access. Then use a less-privileged account and attempt to access each item of this functionality. <br/>&emsp;<span style="color:#ff5050">&#8226;</span>  Using Burp, browse all the application’s content within one user context.<br/>&emsp;<span style="color:#ff5050">&#8226;</span>  Review the contents of Burp’s site map to ensure you have identified all the functionality you want to test. Then, log out of the application and log back in using a different user context. Use the context menu to select the <span style="color:#ff5050">compare site maps</span> feature to determine which high-privileged requests may be accessible to the lower-privileged user.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If the application enforces horizontal privilege segregation, perform the equivalent test using two different accounts at the same privilege level, attempting to use one account to access data belonging to the other account. This typically involves replacing an identifier (such as a document ID) within a request to specify a resource belonging to the other user.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Perform manual checking of key access control logic. <br/>&emsp;<span style="color:#ff5050">&#8226;</span>  For each user privilege, review resources available to a user. Attempt to access those resources from an unauthorized user account by replaying the request using the unauthorized user’s session token.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">When you perform any kind of access control test, be sure to test every step of multistage functions individually to confirm whether access controls have been properly implemented at each stage, or whether the application assumes that users who access a later stage must have passed security checks implemented at the earlier stages. For example, if an administrative page containing a form is properly protected, check whether the actual form submission is also subjected to proper access controls.</a></li>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">If you do not have prior access to accounts at different privilege levels, or to multiple accounts with access to different data, testing for broken access controls is not quite as straightforward. Many common vulnerabilities will be much harder to locate, because you do not know the names of the URLs, identifiers, and parameters that are needed to exploit the weaknesses.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">In your application mapping exercises that use a low-privileged account, you may have identified the URLs for privileged functions such as administrative interfaces. If these are not adequately protected, you will probably already know about this.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Decompile all compiled clients that are present, and extract any references to server-side functionality.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Most data that is subject to horizontal access controls is accessed using an identifier, such as an account number or order reference. To test whether access controls are effective using only a single account, you must try to guess or discover the identifiers associated with other users’ data. If possible, generate a series of identifiers in quick succession (for example, by creating several new orders). Attempt to identify any patterns that may enable you to predict the identifiers issued to other users. If there is no way to generate new identifiers, you are probably restricted to analyzing those you already have and guessing on that basis.</a></li>

To test for this behavior, attempt to perform some privileged actions to which you are authorized, and submit a missing or modified <span style="color:#ff5050">Referer header</span>.

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Review the results of your application mapping exercises and identify every distinct client request that submits parameters that the server-side application processes. Relevant parameters include items within the URL query string, parameters in the request body, and HTTP cookies. Also include any other items of user input that have been observed to have an effect on the application’s behavior, such as the <span style="color:#ff5050">Referer</span> or <span style="color:#ff5050">User-Agent</span> headers.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">To fuzz the parameters, you can use your own scripts or a ready-made fuzzing tool. For example, to use Burp Intruder, load each request in turn into the tool. An easy way to do this is to intercept a request in <span style="color:#ff5050">Burp Proxy</span> and select the <span style="color:#ff5050">Send to Intruder</span> action, or right-click an item in the Burp Proxy history and select this option. Using this option configures Burp Intruder with the contents of the request, along with the correct target host and port. It also automatically marks the values of all request parameters as payload positions, ready for fuzzing.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Using the payloads tab, configure a suitable set of attack payloads to probe for vulnerabilities within the application. You can enter payloads manually, load them from a file, or select one of the preset payload lists. Fuzzing every request parameter within the application typically entails issuing a large number of requests and reviewing the results for anomalies. If your set of attack strings is too large, this can be counterproductive and generate a prohibitively large amount of output for you to review. Hence, a sensible approach is to target a range of common vulnerabilities that can often be easily detected in anomalous responses to specific crafted inputs and that often manifest themselves anywhere within the application rather than within specific types of functionality. Here is a suitable set of payloads that you can use to test for some common categories of vulnerabilities: <br/><br/> <img src=img/all.png height="620" width="449"></a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">All the preceding payloads are shown in their literal form. The characters <span style="color:#ff5050"> ? ; & + = </span>and <span style="color:#ff5050">space</span> need to be URL-encoded because they have special meaning within HTTP requests. By default, Burp Intruder performs the necessary encoding of these characters, so ensure that this option has not been disabled. (To restore all options to their defaults following earlier customization, select <span style="color:#ff5050">Burp</span> &#8594; <span style="color:#ff5050">Restore Defaults</span>.)</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">In the <span style="color:#ff5050">Grep</span> function of Burp Intruder, configure a suitable set of strings to flag some common error messages within responses. For example: <br/> <span style="color:#ff5050">error<br/> exception<br/> illegal<br/> invalid<br/> fail<br/> stack<br/> access<br/> directory<br/> file<br/> not found<br/> varchar<br/> ODBC<br/> SQL<br/> SELECT<br/> 111111<br/> </span>Note that the string <span style="color:#ff5050">111111</span> is included to test for successful script injection attacks.<br/></a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Also select the <span style="color:#ff5050">Payload Grep</span> option to flag responses that contain the payload itself, indicating a potential XSS or header injection vulnerability.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Set up a web server or netcat listener on the host you specified in the first file inclusion payload. This helps you monitor for connection attempts received from the server resulting from a successful remote file inclusion attack.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Launch the attack. When it has completed, review the results for anomalous responses indicating the presence of vulnerabilities. Check for divergences in the HTTP status code, the response length, the response time, the appearance of your configured expressions, and the appearance of the payload itself. You can click each column heading in the results table to sort the results by the values in that column (and Shift-click to reverse-sort the results). This enables you to quickly identify any anomalies that stand out from the other results.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">For each potential vulnerability indicated by the results of your fuzz testing, refer to the following sections of this methodology. They describe the detailed steps you should take in relation to each category of problem to verify the existence of a vulnerability and successfully exploit it.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">After you have configured Burp Intruder to perform a fuzz test of a single request, you can quickly repeat the same test on other requests within the application. Simply select each target request within Burp Proxy and choose the <span style="color:#ff5050">Send to Intruder</span> option. Then immediately launch the attack within Intruder using the existing attack configuration. In this way, you can launch a large number of tests simultaneously in separate windows and manually review the results as each test completes its work.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If your mapping exercises identified any out-of-band input channels whereby user-controllable input can be introduced into the application’s processing, you should perform a similar fuzzing exercise on these input channels. Submit various crafted data designed to trigger common vulnerabilities when processed within the web application. Depending on the nature of the input channel, you may need to create a custom script or other harness for this purpose.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">In addition to your own fuzzing of application requests, if you have access to an automated web application vulnerability scanner, you should run it against the target application to provide a basis for comparison with your own findings.</a></li>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">If the SQL attack strings listed in step 7.1.(3rd) result in any anomalous responses, probe the application’s handling of the relevant parameter manually to determine whether a SQL injection vulnerability is present.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If any database error messages were returned, investigate their meaning.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If submitting a single quotation mark in the parameter causes an error or other anomalous behavior, submit two single quotation marks. If this input causes the error or anomalous behavior to disappear, the application is probably vulnerable to SQL injection.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Try using common SQL string concatenator functions to construct a string that is equivalent to some benign input. If this causes the same response as the original benign input, the application is probably vulnerable. For example, if the original input is the expression <span style="color:#ff5050">FOO</span>, you can perform this test using the following items (in the third example, note the space between the two quotes): <br/> <span style="color:#ff5050">‘||’FOO<br/> ‘+’FOO<br/> ‘ ‘FOO<br/> </span>As always, be sure to URL-encode characters such as <span style="color:#ff5050">+</span> and space that have special meaning within HTTP requests. </a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If the original input is numeric, try using a mathematical expression that is equivalent to the original value. For example, if the original value was 2, try submitting 1+1 or 3–1. If the application responds in the same way, it may be vulnerable, particularly if the value of the numeric expression has a systematic effect on the application’s behavior.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If the preceding test is successful, you can gain further assurance that a SQL injection vulnerability is involved by using SQL-specific mathematical expressions to construct a particular value. If the application’s logic can be systematically manipulated in this way, it is almost certainly vulnerable to SQL injection. For example, both of the following items are equivalent to the number 2:<br/> <span style="color:#ff5050"> 67-ASCII(‘A’)<br/> 51-ASCII(1)<br/></span></a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If either of the fuzz test cases using the <span style="color:#ff5050">waitfor</span> command resulted in an abnormal time delay before the application responded, this is a strong indicator that the database type is MS-SQL and the application is vulnerable to SQL injection. Repeat the test manually, specifying different values in the waitfor parameter, and determine whether the time taken to respond varies systematically with this value.

Repeat the test, manually specifying different values in the <span style="color:#ff5050">-i</span> or <span style="color:#ff5050">-n</span> parameter, and determine whether the time taken to respond varies systematically with this value.</a></li>

						<li><a href="#0">If you are unable to retrieve results directly, other options are open to you:<br/>&emsp;<span style="color:#ff5050">&#8226;</span> You can attempt to open an out-of-band channel back to your computer.

For example:<br/><span style="color:#ff5050">&emsp;&emsp;dir > c:\inetpub\wwwroot\foo.txt</span></a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If you find a way to inject commands and retrieve the results, you should determine your privilege level (by using <span style="color:#ff5050">whoami</span> or a similar command, or attempting to write a harmless file to a protected directory). You may then seek to escalate privileges, gain backdoor access to sensitive application data, or attack other hosts that can be reached from the compromised server.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If you believe that your input is being passed to an OS command of some kind, but the attack strings listed are unsuccessful, see if you can use the <span style="color:#ff5050"><</span> or <span style="color:#ff5050">></span> character to direct the contents of a file to the command’s input or to direct the command’s output to a file. This may enable you to read or write arbitrary file contents.

						<li><a href="#0">In your mapping of the application’s attack surface, you should have noted any functionality that specifically supports the reading and writing of files on the basis of user-supplied input. In addition to the general fuzzing of all parameters, you should manually test this functionality very carefully to identify any path traversal vulnerabilities that exist.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Where a parameter appears to contain a filename, a portion of a filename, or a directory, modify the parameter’s existing value to insert an arbitrary subdirectory and a single traversal sequence.

If the behavior is different, the application may be blocking, stripping, or sanitizing traversal sequences, resulting in an invalid file path. Try using the encoding and other attacks in an attempt to bypass the filters.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If the preceding test of using traversal sequences within the base directory is successful, try using additional sequences to step above the base directory and access known files on the server’s operating system. If these attempts fail, the application may be imposing various filters or checks before file access is granted. You should probe further to understand the controls that are implemented and whether any bypasses exist.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">The application may be checking the file extension being requested and allowing access to only certain kinds of files. Try using a null byte or newline attack together with a known accepted file extension in an attempt to bypass the filter. For example:<br/><span style="color:#ff5050">../../../../../boot.ini%00.jpg</span><br/><span style="color:#ff5050"> ../../../../../etc/passwd%0a.jpg</span></a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">The application may be checking that the user-supplied file path starts with a particular directory or stem. Try appending traversal sequences after a known accepted stem in an attempt to bypass the filter. For example:<br/><span style="color:#ff5050">/images/../../../../../../../etc/passwd</span></a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If these attacks are unsuccessful, try combining multiple bypasses, working initially entirely within the base directory in an attempt to understand the filters in place and the ways in which the application handles unexpected input.</a></li>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">When a multistage process involves a defined sequence of requests, attempt to submit these requests out of the expected sequence. Try skipping certain stages, accessing a single stage more than once, and accessing earlier stages after later ones.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">The sequence of stages may be accessed via a series of <span style="color:#ff5050">GET</span> or <span style="color:#ff5050">POST</span> requests for distinct URLs, or they may involve submitting different sets of parameters to the same URL. You may specify the stage being requested by submitting a function name or index within a request parameter. Be sure to understand fully the mechanisms that the application is employing to deliver access to distinct stages.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">In addition to interfering with the sequence of steps, try taking parameters that are submitted at one stage of the process and submitting them at a different stage. If the relevant items of data are updated within the application’s state, you should investigate whether you can leverage this behavior to interfere with the application’s logic.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If a multistage process involves different users performing operations on the same set of data, try taking each parameter submitted by one user and submitting it as another. If they are accepted and processed as that user, explore the implications of this behavior, as described previously.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">From the context of the functionality that is implemented, try to understand what assumptions the developers may have made and where the key attack surface lies. Try to identify ways of violating those assumptions to cause undesirable behavior within the application.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">When multistage functions are accessed out of sequence, it is common to encounter a variety of anomalous conditions within the application, such as variables with null or uninitialized values, partially defined or inconsistent state, and other unpredictable behavior. Look for interesting error messages and debug output, which you can use to better understand the application’s internal workings and thereby fine-tune the current or a different attack.</a></li>
