					<label for="sub-group-1">Explore Visible Content</label>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Configure Burp to passively spider the site.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Browse the entire application in the normal way, visiting every link and URL, submitting every form, and proceeding through all multistep functions to completion. Try browsing with JavaScript enabled and disabled, and with cookies enabled and disabled. Many applications can handle various browser configurations, and you may reach different content and code paths within the application.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If the application uses authentication, and you have or can create a login account, use this to access the protected functionality.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">As you browse, monitor the requests and responses passing through your intercepting proxy to gain an understanding of the kinds of data being submitted and the ways in which the client is used to control the behavior of the server-side application.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Review the site map generated by the passive spidering, and identify any content or functionality that you have not walked through using your browser. From the spider results, establish where each item was discov- ered (for example, in Burp Spider, check the Linked From details). Access each item using your browser so that the spider parses the response from the server to identify any further content. Continue this step recursively until no further content or functionality is identified.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">When you have finished manually browsing and passively spidering, you can use your spider to actively crawl the application, using the set of discovered URLs as seeds. This may sometimes uncover additional content that you overlooked when working manually. Before doing an automated crawl, first identify any URLs that are dangerous or likely to break the application session, and then configure the spider to exclude these from its scope.</a></li>
					</ul>
      			</li>

      			<li class="has-children">
      				<input type="checkbox" name ="sub-group-2" id="sub-group-2">
					<label for="sub-group-2">Consult Public Resources</label>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Use search engines and archives (such as the Wayback Machine) to identify what content they have indexed and stored for your target application.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Use advanced search options to improve the effectiveness of your research. For example, on Google you can use <span style="color:#ff5050">site:</span> to retrieve all the content for your target site and <span style="color:#ff5050">link:</span> to retrieve other sites that link to it. If your search identifies content that is no longer present in the live application, you may still be able to view this from the search engine’s cache. This old content may contain links to additional resources that have not yet been removed.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Perform searches on any names and e-mail addresses you have discovered in the application’s content, such as contact information. Include items not rendered on-screen, such as HTML comments. In addition to web searches, perform news and group searches. Look for any technical details posted to Internet forums regarding the target application and its supporting infrastructure.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Review any published WSDL files to generate a list of function names and parameter values potentially employed by the application.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Use Discover script: <span style="color:#ff5050">https://github.com/leebaird/discover</span> to automate some of these tasks.</a></li>						
					</ul>
      			</li>

      			<li class="has-children">
      				<input type="checkbox" name ="sub-group-3" id="sub-group-3">
					<label for="sub-group-3">Discover Hidden Content</label>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Confirm how the application handles requests for nonexistent items. Make some manual requests for known valid and invalid resources, and compare the server’s responses to establish an easy way to identify when an item does not exist.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Obtain listings of common file and directory names and common file extensions. Add to these lists all the items actually observed within the applications, and also items inferred from these. Try to understand the naming conventions used by application developers. For example, if there are pages called AddDocument.jsp and ViewDocument.jsp, there may also be pages called EditDocument.jsp and RemoveDocument.jsp.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Review all client-side code to identify any clues about hidden server-side
content, including HTML comments and disabled form elements.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Using the automation techniques(i.e dirb web content scanner) make large numbers of requests based on your directory, filename, and file extension lists. Monitor the server’s responses to confirm which items are present and accessible.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Perform these content-discovery exercises recursively, using new enumerated content and patterns as the basis for further user-directed spidering and further automated discovery.</a></li>
					</ul>
      			</li>      			


      			<li class="has-children">
      				<input type="checkbox" name ="sub-group-4" id="sub-group-4">
					<label for="sub-group-4">Discover Default Content</label>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Run Nikto against the web server to detect any default or well-known content that is present. Use Nikto’s options to maximize its effectiveness. For example, you can use the <span style="color:#ff5050">–root</span> option to specify a directory to check for default content, or <span style="color:#ff5050">-404</span> to specify a string that identifies a custom File Not Found page.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Verify any potentially interesting findings manually to eliminate any false positives within the results.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Request the server’s root directory, specifying the IP address in the Host header, and determine if the application responds with any different content. If so, run a Nikto scan against the IP address as well as the server name.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Make a request to the server’s root directory, specifying a range of <span style="color:#ff5050">User-Agent headers</span>, as shown at <span style="color:#ff5050">www.useragentstring.com/pages/ useragentstring.php</span>.</a></li>
					</ul>
      			</li>      			

      			<li class="has-children">
      				<input type="checkbox" name ="sub-group-5" id="sub-group-5">
					<label for="sub-group-5">Enumerate Identifier-Specified Functions</label>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Identify any instances where specific application functions are accessed by passing an identifier of the function in a request parameter (for example, <span style="color:#ff5050">/admin.jsp?action=editUser</span> or <span style="color:#ff5050">/main.php?func=A21)</span>.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If the application uses a parameter containing a function name, first determine its behavior when an invalid function is specified, and try to establish an easy way to identify when a valid function has been requested. Compile a list of common function names or cycle through the syntactic range of identifiers observed to be in use. Automate the exercise with scripts.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">If applicable, compile a map of application content based on functional paths, rather than URLs, showing all the enumerated functions and the logical paths and dependencies between them (i.e. Burp Target feature). </a></li>
					</ul>
      			</li>

      			<li class="has-children">
      				<input type="checkbox" name ="sub-group-6" id="sub-group-6">
					<label for="sub-group-6">Test for Debug Parameters</label>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="#0">Choose one or more application pages or functions where hidden debug parameters (such as debug=true) may be implemented. These are most likely to appear in key functionality such as login, search, and file upload or download.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Use listings of common debug parameter names (such as<span style="color:#ff5050">debug, test, hide</span>, and <span style="color:#ff5050">source</span>) and common values (such as <span style="color:#ff5050">true, yes, on</span>, and <span style="color:#ff5050">1</span>). Iterate through all permutations of these, submitting each name/value pair to each targeted function. For <span style="color:#ff5050">POST</span> requests, supply the parameter in both the URL query string and the request body. For example, you can use the cluster bomb attack type in Burp Intruder to combine all permutations of two payload lists.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#0">Review the application’s responses for any anomalies that may indicate that the added parameter has had an effect on the application’s processing.</a></li>
